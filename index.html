    <h1>Privacy Policy — EngQuiz</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 September 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>EngQuiz</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the App”). EngQuiz is a mobile application designed to help students practice and learn English through offline quizzes and progress tracking. Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App uses, how it is stored, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Key points:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>EngQuiz stores data only on your device (local storage) — it does <strong>not</strong> send data to our servers or to third parties.</li>
        <li>The App does not require an internet connection to work; all quizzes and progress are static and local.</li>
        <li>If you choose to export or backup data manually, that action is performed by you and not automatically shared.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>No personal information collection by default.</strong> EngQuiz is intentionally designed to work offline and locally. The App collects and stores only the following data on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Learning progress and scores:</strong> quiz results, levels completed, streaks, and other progress indicators.</li>
      <li><strong>App settings and preferences:</strong> chosen language level, notification preferences (local), UI preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Local files:</strong> any user-imported content that you explicitly add to the app (if that feature is provided).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Do NOT Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect or transmit personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, emails, or phone numbers by default.</li>
      <li>We do not send your quiz results or progress to any remote servers or third-party analytics services.</li>
      <li>We do not use tracking cookies or advertising identifiers while the App is used offline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local-Only Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>All data described above is stored locally on your device using the platform’s local storage mechanisms (for example, internal app storage or secure local databases). Because data is stored locally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only someone who has access to your device can access that data.</li>
      <li>To clear all stored data, you may use the App’s <em>Clear Data</em> function (if provided), or uninstall the App which removes its local storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Optional Export / Backup</h2>
    <p>If the App offers a manual export or backup feature, you may choose to export progress to a file or to your cloud provider. Such an export is <strong>initiated by you</strong> and not automatic. We strongly recommend reviewing any destination before exporting because we are not responsible for third-party storage policies.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>EngQuiz is educational. If the App is made available for children under 13 (or under the relevant age in your jurisdiction), note the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not knowingly request or collect personal information from children.</li>
      <li>All learning data for children is stored locally on the device.</li>
      <li>If you are a parent or guardian and want data removed, please use the App’s data-delete option or uninstall the App from the child’s device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal & Regulatory Notices (GDPR / CCPA / COPPA)</h2>
    <p>We aim to respect common user privacy rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EU (GDPR)</strong> — If you are an EU resident, you have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data. Since EngQuiz does not automatically collect personal data, those rights are typically exercised by clearing local data or uninstalling the App.</li>
      <li><strong>California (CCPA)</strong> — California residents may request information about data collection. As above, EngQuiz does not collect personal data remotely.</li>
      <li><strong>Children (COPPA)</strong> — The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Parents may delete local data or uninstall the App at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note:</em> This section is informational. If you need formal legal help regarding these laws, please consult a qualified attorney.</p>

    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect data stored on your device, but no method of local storage is 100% secure. Please protect access to your device and use device-level security (passcode, biometrics) if available.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>EngQuiz does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or cloud services by default. If you or a future update enable an optional feature that uses the internet (for example, cloud backup), we will clearly disclose the change and provide an updated privacy statement.</p>

    <h2>How to Delete or Export Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Use the in-app “Clear Data” option (if present) or uninstall the App to remove stored data from the device.</li>
      <li><strong>Export / Backup:</strong> Use the in-app export feature (if available) to save a local backup file. Exported files are saved to locations you choose and are subject to those storage providers’ rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally (for example if we add new features or change how data is handled). If a future version requires online data collection, we will obtain user consent and publish an updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Policy or about data stored by EngQuiz, please contact us:</p>
